# Mathis Gaignet

iOS Developer focused on Clean Architecture, Swift Concurrency, and building apps that people actually want to use.

## What I Build

**Albedo** — Satellite tracking app on the App Store
Real-time orbital mechanics, custom Swift Charts for magnitude analysis, WeatherKit integration, and a custom Swift Package for shadow computations. Built with Clean Architecture, actors for thread-safe caching, and parallel API calls using TaskGroups.

**BarTinder** — Open-source cocktail discovery app
Tinder-like ingredient swiping with Apple Intelligence integration using Foundation Models for AI-powered recipe generation. Features SwiftData with custom abstraction layers, full Swift Testing coverage, and Clean Architecture throughout.


## Technical Approach

I write Swift with a focus on:
- Clean Architecture, MVVM, or MVC with proper separation of concerns
- Swift Concurrency (actors, TaskGroups, structured concurrency)
- Comprehensive testing with Swift Testing
- SwiftUI for modern, declarative interfaces
- Custom Swift Packages when needed

I've written technical articles on Swift 6.2 Concurrency and SwiftUI internals that received 400+ engagements on Medium.

## Background

Former audio engineer who transitioned to iOS development. I spent three years working with sound systems, live events, and technical troubleshooting before diving deep into iOS development. That background taught me to work under pressure, adapt quickly to new technical environments, and solve problems systematically.

## Currently

Learning Swedish and preparing to relocate to Stockholm. Open to iOS developer roles in Sweden and across Europe.
