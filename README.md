# Step into my SwiftUI universe

Hey, I'm Mathis, an iOS developer who loves Swift and SwiftUI. I follow the latest updates, watch WWDC every year, and enjoy writing clean, modern code. I also fell in love with Swift Concurrency 🛠

## What I've built

**[Albedo](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/albedo/id6744074239?l=en-GB)** - A satellite tracking app that shows upcoming passes of major satellites based on your location. Native interface following Apple's design standards, with complete astrodynamics implementation (SGP4, TLE, ECI/ECEF), real-time ground tracks, observation statistics powered by WeatherKit, and a custom SPM for orbital mechanics calculations (Earth shadow transitions, apparent magnitude, albedo).

**[BarTinder](https://github.com/MathGnt/BarTinder)** - An open-source cocktail discovery, creation, and management app. Originally designed as a learning resource for SwiftUI, it demonstrates core concepts: views, lists, refactoring, gesture animations (including Tinder-style swipe). BarTinder leverages Foundation Models (Apple Intelligence) to bring ideas to life, uses SwiftData for persistence, and is fully tested with SwiftTesting through XcodeCloud.

## Technical approach

I write Swift with a focus on:

- **Idiomatic SwiftUI**: modern, declarative, and readable interfaces
- **Clean Architecture** & MVVM
- **Swift 6 Concurrency** and beyond (6.2+)

## Articles

I also write articles to help the community. Here are some of them:
